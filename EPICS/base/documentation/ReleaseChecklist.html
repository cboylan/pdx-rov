<h1>EPICS Base Release Procedures &amp; Checklist</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>ReleaseChecklist.html,v 1.1.2.8 2008/06/09 21:17:16 anj Exp</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This document describes the procedures and provides a checklist of tasks
that should be performed when creating new releases of EPICS Base.</p>

<h3>The Release Process</h3>

<p>The version released on the Feature Freeze date is designated the first
pre-release, <tt>-pre1</tt>. The first Release Candidate <tt>-RC1</tt> is the
first version that has undergone widespread testing and which has no known
problems in it that are slated to be fixed in this release. New versions should
be made at about weekly intervals during the testing and debugging period, and
will be designated as either pre-release versions or Release Candidates by the
Release Manager.  A Release Candidate that has received widespread testing for a
week without any additional problems being discovered or significant changes
being committed can be designated as the final release version.</p>

<h3>Roles</h3>

<p>The following roles are required. The individuals named here have have been
responsible for these tasks in the past and are expected to continue in the
relevent roles unless the Release Manager designates otherwise:</p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Release Manager</strong> (Andrew Johnson)</dt>
    <dd>Responsible for the release</dd>
  <dt><strong>Configuration Manager</strong> (Janet Anderson)</dt>
    <dd>Responsible for committing version number updates to CVS and for
      creating tarfiles</dd>
  <dt><strong>Platform Developers</strong></dt>
    <dd>Responsible for individual operating system platforms</dd>
  <dt><strong>Application Developers</strong></dt>
    <dd>Responsible for support modules that depend on EPICS Base.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Website Manager</strong> (Andrew Johnson)</dt>
    <dd>Responsible for the EPICS website</dd>
</dl>
